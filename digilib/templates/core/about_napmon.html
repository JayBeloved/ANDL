            <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <p>
                    In 2013, God said to me the following words "as Kenneth Hagin led the faith movement, you are leading the next apostolic movement."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2022, the year of no limit, God spoke to me that the coming apostolic movement won't be limited to one stream or some streams. It's going to have all the streams present.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2023, I asked what's the new beginning and new waves about. He told me it's the Apostolic Movement but it also combined the prophetic. It's new waves because it a combination of the Apostolic and Prophetic. So He revealed Apostolic-Prophetic Movement.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2024, I asked what's the far ahead and far above about? He explained, the movement is far ahead and far above every previous movements in ...
                    So, one afternoon, I was in prayer and I heard an angel shouted the following words "NIYI MAKINDE - THE FATHER OF THE NEW APOSTOLIC AND PROPHETIC MOVEMENT." 
                    I was very shocked and fearful at the same time. I asked what that meant and it was revealed to me that what the angel shouted was God's decree in heaven. It was just communicated to me that afternoon. It was that encounter that brought clarity to the name: NEW APOSTOLIC AND PROPHETIC MOVEMENT OF NIGERIA.
